# Book Reader Web Application - Complete Project Description

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose
To develop a comprehensive web application that allows users to upload, organize, read, and interact with digital books across various formats, while providing administrators with tools to manage the platform and its content.

### Target Audience

- Students and academics who need annotation and research tools
- Book collectors who need organization systems
- Reading groups and book clubs
- Educational institutions and libraries

### Core Value Proposition
A unified reading ecosystem that combines personal library management, advanced reading features, and social interaction within a responsive, accessible web application.

## 2. System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux for global state, Context API for component states
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
- **Rendering Engines**: epub.js for EPUB, pdf.js for PDF, custom renderers for other formats
- **Progressive Web App**: Service workers for offline functionality and caching

### Backend
- **Server**: Node.js with Express.js
- **API**: RESTful architecture with GraphQL for complex data retrieval
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with OAuth social login integration
- **Databases**:
  - MongoDB for document storage (books, annotations, user data)
